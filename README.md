# RHEX

![logo](logo.png)

**RHEX** is a lightweight and secure command-line password and key manager written in Python. It provides encrypted local storage, configurable key generation, and a compact CLI workflow for creating, saving, listing, and resetting entries.

---

## Features

- Secure local password and key storage
- AES-GCM authenticated encryption for stored entries
- Configurable key length and charset via `config.toml`
- Automatic clipboard copy after new key generation
- Master password protection with optional Argon2id verification
- Encrypted backup archive with timestamped snapshots
- Automatic dependency installation if required packages are missing
- Fast CLI workflow with `--new-master-key`, `--list-keys`, and `--delete-all`

---

## Release Notes

### 0.0.5

- Added encrypted backup support with timestamped snapshot copies
- Added configurable key generation options for lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols
- Added automatic dependency install fallback on startup
- Added CLI `--new-master-key` option for initial master password creation
- Improved README documentation and configuration examples

---

## Why RHEX?

RHEX was built with a simple philosophy: password management should be secure, straightforward, and free from unnecessary complexity.

Unlike larger password managers, RHEX focuses on local encrypted storage, a minimal dependency footprint, and a clean command-line experience.

---

## Security

Security is the primary goal of RHEX.

All stored data is encrypted using **AES-GCM**, providing both confidentiality and integrity.

Master password verification supports two modes:

- SHA-256 (default)
- Argon2id (recommended)

When `security_mode` is enabled in `config.toml`, the master password is stored using Argon2id hashing. Otherwise it uses SHA-256 with padded input.

> **Security Notice**
>
> RHEX uses modern cryptographic techniques, but users should review the source code and keep backups of important data separately.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer

Required packages:

- colorama
- pyfiglet
- pyperclip
- pyfastfile
- argon2-cffi
- pycryptodome

Install dependencies using:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If required packages are missing, RHEX can automatically install them from `requirements.txt` during startup.

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batuhansenol/RHEX.git
```

Enter the project directory:

```bash
cd RHEX
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Create a master password

```bash
python main.py --new-master-key <master_password>
```

Use this on first run when no master key exists. After the master key is created, use the standard workflow to generate and save keys.

### Generate and save a new key

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will:

1. Verify the master password.
2. Generate a secure random key.
3. Copy the new key to the clipboard.
4. Ask if you want to save the key under a name.
5. Encrypt and store the entry if confirmed.

If you choose not to save, press Enter when prompted for a password.

### List stored entries

```bash
python main.py --list-keys
```

### Delete all stored data

```bash
python main.py --delete-all
```

---

## Data Storage

RHEX stores encrypted files locally in the `data/` folder:

- `data/key.txt` — hashed or Argon2id-hashed master key
- `data/data.enc` — encrypted password/key database
- `data/backup.zip` — encrypted backup archive containing historical copies of `data.enc`
- `data/data.txt` — temporary decrypted file created during operations and deleted afterward

Keep the `data/` folder private. Enabling `security_mode` stores the master key using Argon2id.

---

## Configuration

Example `config.toml`:

```toml
[app]
name = "RHEX"

[key]
length = 20
master_key_length = 10
lowercase_letters = true
uppercase_letters = false
special_characters = false
figures = true

[encryption]
encryption_mode = "gcm"

[advanced_settings]
security_mode = true
delete_all_operation_sleep_time = 0
list_all_operation_sleep_time = 0
add_key_sleep_time = 0

[argon2]
time_cost = 5
memory_cost = 262144
parallelism = 4
hash_len = 32
salt_len = 16
```

| `special_characters` | Include symbols in generated keys |
| `figures` | Include digits in generated keys |
| `security_mode` | Enables Argon2id master password verification |
| `encryption_mode` | Encryption mode used for stored data |
| `delete_all_operation_sleep_time` | Delay after delete-all failure |
| `list_all_operation_sleep_time` | Delay after list-keys failure |
| `add_key_sleep_time` | Delay after failed save operation |
